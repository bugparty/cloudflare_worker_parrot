# CF Parrot ðŸ¦œ

A Cloudflare Worker implementation of [parrot.live](https://github.com/hugomd/parrot.live), bringing animated party parrots to your terminal through Cloudflare's edge network.

## Try it!

```bash
curl https://parrot.0x1f0c.dev
```

## About

This project is a Cloudflare Worker version of the popular [parrot.live](https://github.com/hugomd/parrot.live) project. It allows you to display an animated party parrot in your terminal using a simple `curl` command, but with the added benefits of Cloudflare's global edge network:

- Ultra-low latency worldwide
- High availability
- Automatic HTTPS
- Zero server maintenance

## How it Works

The project uses Cloudflare Workers to serve ASCII art frames of an animated parrot. When you make a request using `curl`, the worker streams the animation frames to your terminal, creating a smooth animation effect.
